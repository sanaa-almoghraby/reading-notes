# A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS
   A script is a series of instructions that a
   computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
-----------------------------------------------
** WRITING A SCRIPT **

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3. CODE EACH STEP

# EXPRESSIONS

* STRING OPERATOR 
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
1. FUNCTION DECLARATION 

function area (width, height){
return width * height;
};
var size= area (3, 4) ;



2.FUNCTION EXPRESSION 


var ar ea = f unction(width, height) {
r eturn width * height;
} ;
var size = area (3, 4) ;
