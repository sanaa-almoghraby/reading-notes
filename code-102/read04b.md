## How does a Computer work?

1.**Input**: An input is the information that we   provide to the Computer. We provide the          
  information using the Computer's input devices:   Keyboard, mouse, microphone, and many more. For example, when we type something using a keyboard, it is known as an Input provided to the Computer.
2. **Storage** Space: It is the place where our input gets stored. It is known as Computer Memory that keeps the data into it. A computer uses a hard drive for storing files and documents. It uses two types of memory, i.e., internal memory and external memory. Internal memory is known as RAM, which is volatile in nature. It stores data temporarily, i.e., when the data is ready to be processed, is loaded into RAM, and after processing, it moves data for the storage. On the other hand, external memory is used to store data permanently until you remove it or it got crashed.
3.**Processing:** The processing of the input is performed by the CPU, which is the Central Processing Unit of the Computer. It is also known as the brain of a computer that is responsible for processing the data provided by the user. The speed of the computer brain is four times faster than the speed of the human brain.
4. **Output:** When we type something using a keyboard, the place where we see the typed input is the Computer Monitor or Computer Screen. A computer screen allows seeing the input we provided to the Computer. Including this, there are different types of output devices of a computer, such as loudspeakers, projectors, printers, and many more.

All computer data including text, images and sound is represented using binary. Work between ASCII and Unicode to understand the relationship between them. Encode images using binary. Explore converting between text and sound and the file formats used to store files. Create a website for a user that requires audio support.

** Logic circuits**
Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate.

An input device sends information to a computer system for processing, and an output device reproduces or displays the results of that processing. ... Those signals are then interpreted by the computer and displayed, or output, on the monitor as text or images
**hardware and software**
Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer's hard drive. ... Word processing software uses the computer processor, memory, and hard drive to generate and save documents. In a computer, hardware is what makes a computer work.
