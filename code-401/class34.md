### Sell goods or services through your app
When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.

### Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system
 Google Play's billing system makes it easy for users to consistently, securely, and seamlessly purchase your goods and services for your app.
 Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:
 * Virtual game products, 
 * App functionality or content,
 * Subscription services
 * Cloud software products

 ### Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay
 Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside of your app. Google Pay provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online, both in apps and wherever contactless payments are accepted.
 ### Other app monetization options
 * Advertising
 * Paid apps

# Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy
* Research other apps in your category
* Think about how your app will be used
* Make use of natural extensions
* Consider your cost structures
* Consider your audience
* Consider local factors when setting prices
