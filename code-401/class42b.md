### The code I’m still ashamed of

If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not outright unethical. As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.

### Self Driving Car Ethics

If a car drove by a human, and it may be veers sharply toward you. There is no time to stop safely, and no time for you to take control of the car.

There are some possibles maybe happen:

    It possibly killing you but possibly saving the bus and its occupants

maybe you perform a sharp evasive maneuver around the bus and into the oncoming lane, possibly saving you, but sending the bus and its driver swerving into the trees, killing her and some of the children on board.

        Hitting the bus, possibly killing you as well as the driver and kids on the bus.

    This may be happen in the everyday driving where a moral snap judgment must be made.
