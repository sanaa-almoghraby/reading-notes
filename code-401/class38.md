# Amplify Framework Documentation

### The open-source Amplify Framework provides the following products to build fullstack iOS, Android, Flutter, Web, and React Native apps:

* Amplify CLI - Configure all the services needed to power your backend through a simple command line interface.
* Amplify Libraries - Use case-centric client libraries to integrate your app code with a backend using declarative interfaces.
* Amplify UI Components - UI libraries for React, React Native, Angular, Ionic and Vue.
The Amplify Console is an AWS service that provides a git-based workflow for continuous deployment & hosting of fullstack web apps. Cloud resources created by the Amplify CLI are also visible in the Amplify Console.

*  we'll define a GraphQL schema that we can use to provision backend resources, store data locally, sync to a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

GraphQL is a data language that was developed to enable apps to fetch data from APIs. It has a declarative, self-documenting style. In a GraphQL operation, the client specifies how to structure the data when it is returned by the server. This makes it possible for the client to query only for the data it needs, in the format that it needs it in.
