# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
# Directed vs Undirected
* Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
* Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

# Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

# Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

# Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

# Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

# Acyclic vs Cyclic
*  Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
* Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.7

# Graph Representation
We represent graphs through:

* Adjacency Matrix
An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isnâ€™t a connection.
* Adjacency List


* Adjacency List
An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.

# Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights


An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.


# Depth First
In a depth first traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree. Similar to how the breadth-first uses a queue, we are going to use a Stack for our depth-first traversal.
