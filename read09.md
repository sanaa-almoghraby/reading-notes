## A Text Editor
--------------------------------------------------
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
--------------------------------------------------
When I first started out learning about web development, one of the
things that I felt compelled to do was to download a text editor. I
figured that I was going to be writing a good deal of code, and a good
text editor should help me do that.
** Can you use the text editor that you love,**
---------------------------------------------------
## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer  ##
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different
names. One distro might have “Gedit,” and others might have other
titles. Check you list of applications to see which text editor comes
with your distribution of Linux.

While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites,
there are other text editors available that might help you code more
efficiently. I invite you to judge for yourself and form your own
opinions.
## Third-Party Options
1. NotePad++
2. TextWrangler/BB Edit
3. Visual Studio Code

4. Atom

## The Command Line!
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

** there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also**

## Basic Navigation!
1. pwd
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
2. ls
List the contents of a directory.
3. cd
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
---------------------------------------------------
** More on Paths **
* ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
* . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
* .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
--------------------------------------------------
## More About Files!
* file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.
* Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
* Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.
