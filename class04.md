 # Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
    in this part i will introduce you to objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages. Each discussion focuses on how these concepts relate to the real world, while simultaneously providing an introduction to the syntax of the Java programming language.
1. classes :
    A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.
2. objects :
    An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. This lesson explains how state and behavior are represented within an object, introduces the concept of data encapsulation, and explains the benefits of designing your software in this manner.
3.  inheritance :
    Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. This section explains how classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses, and explains how to derive one class from another using the simple syntax provided by the Java programming language.
4. interfaces :
    An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface. This section defines a simple interface and explains the necessary changes for any class that implements it.
5. packages :
    A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage. This section explains why this is useful, and introduces you to the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the Java platform.

Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
We are all familiar with the base 10 number system that we use in our every day lives. The base 10 number system is just one example of a positional number system. In apositional number system a number is represented as a series of digits, where each digit
position is associated with a weight. For example, the number representing the year 2003
can be represented as follows:
2003 = 2 * 103 + 0 * 102 + 0 * 101 + 3 * 100
position 3 2 1 0
As you can see, each weight is the power of 10 to the number position starting at 0. The
* represents multiplication and any number raised to the power of zero = 1;
Binary and Hexadecimal Number Systems
Binary and Hexadecimal number systems are examples of positional number
systems with different bases. Binary number systems use a base of two while
hexadecimal uses a base of 16.
For example, the binary number 1010 is represented as follows:
1011 = 1 * 23 + 0 * 22 + 1 * 21 + 1 * 20 = 1 * 8 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 11 (base 10)

For example, the hexadecimal number 123 is represented as follows:
123 = 1 * 162 + 2 * 161 + 3 * 160 * 0 = 1 * 256 + 32 + 3 = 291 (base 10)
In a hexadecimal system, it is necessary to count to 15. To represent the numbers 10 – 15,
the letters A – F are used respectively. To distinguish the different number systems,
