1. What is node.js?
    Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

    is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser

 2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8     JavaScript Engine?
    responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
    Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

    Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return
4. What is npm?
* Node Package Manager.
    The World's Largest Software Registry (Library)
    npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

    The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

    Open-source developers use npm to share software.

    Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.


5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

v12.22.1

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine? 

6.14.12

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install -g jshint

8. What is node used for?
* create a sensible development environment in which they can run.
* Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.
* For example it can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. It can also be used to write your own command line tool, such as this Yeoman-Style generator to scaffold out new projects.

* Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

all of them 

3. How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
