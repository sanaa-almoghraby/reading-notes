## THE DOCUMENT OBJECT  REPRESENTS AN HTML  PAGE##
--------------------------------------------------
Using the document object, you can access and change what content
users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it. 
# HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 
**n order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the
HTML code and applies styling to it.** 
---------------------------------------------------
1.RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE
2.CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY.
3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN 
All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your
instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow. 
## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT 
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files). 
<!DOCTYPE html >

<html >

<head>

<title>Constructive &amp; Co.</title>


<li nk rel ="stylesheet" href="css/ cOl . css" / >

</ head>

<body>
<hl>Constructive &amp; Co.</hl>
<script>document.write(' <h3>Welcome !</h3>');
</script>
<p>For all orders and inquiries please call
<em>555-3344</ em></ p>
</ body>
</ html >
