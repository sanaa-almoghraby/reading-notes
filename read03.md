# HTML & CSS
** Structure **
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
# YOUR Website
To help determine why people
are coming to your website,
there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:
   1. The first attempts to discover
    the underlying motivations for
    why visitors come to the site.
   2.  The second examines the
    specific goals of the visitors.
    These are the triggers making
    them come to the site now.
# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
   First you want to create a list
of reasons why people would
be coming to your site. You can
then assign the list of tasks to
the fictional visitors you created
in the step described on the
previous page.
# Summary PROCESS & Design
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style
