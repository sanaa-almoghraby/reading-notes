# growth mindset
A **growth mindset** believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

# Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset #
1. Challenges

walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward
2. Obstacles  
    Robert Persig talks about the “gumption trap” – the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it. His solution is to stand       up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired

3. Effort

4. Criticism
    I should learned to ask myself two questions:

       * What was the best part of the day?
       * What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
5. Success of others
    with the help of our culture of openness and honesty, I was able to understand how the work I do relates to the work of my peers, and how it all comes together         to create something awesome.
    It might not be possible to retrofit a company to have a similar level of openness and commitment to authenticity, but it’s not too hard to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions. We can choose to be more transparent or more helpful than might be required or than we’re used to. In other words, we can choose to go the extra mile, we can choose to be quick to praise and slow to criticize. We can choose to seek first to understand.

 A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.
